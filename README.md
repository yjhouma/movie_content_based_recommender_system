# Movie Content-Based Recommender System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a content-based recommender system using the TMDB 5000 dataset. The goal is to recommend movies based on their content, such as genres, keywords, and plot overviews.

## Dataset

The TMDB 5000 dataset contains rich information about movies, including metadata like titles, genres, plot summaries, cast and crew, release dates, and user ratings.

## Model Implementation

We combine all the features into a single matrix and calculate cosine similarity to score and rank movies based on their similarities.
